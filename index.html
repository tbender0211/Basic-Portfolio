            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>With a BA in economics, I am starting over to begin a career I am passionate about.
               When I started college, I felt forced to choose a major almost immediately, even if it wasn't something I was sure I wanted to pursue.
               After college, I took a couple years away from career goals to wait tables, but I eventually grew tired of it. 
               That's what brought me to The University of Kansas coding bootcamp, building my portfolio and hopefully making my way to a new career.
